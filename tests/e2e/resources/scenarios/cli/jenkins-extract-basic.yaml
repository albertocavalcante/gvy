  Verifies that the static extractor correctly scans a real Jenkins plugin
  (workflow-basic-steps) and extracts Step metadata including function names,
  parameters, and block arguments.

workspace:
  fixture: jenkins-extract-test

steps:
  # Step 1: Download the plugin
  - downloadPlugin:
      id: workflow-basic-steps
      version: "1058.vcb_fc1e3a_21a_9"
      source: JENKINS_RELEASES
      saveAs: pluginPath

  # Step 2: Run the CLI extract command
  - cli:
      command: jenkins extract
      args:
        - "--plugins-txt"
        - "{{temp}}/plugins.txt"
        - "--output-dir"
        - "{{temp}}/output"
      saveAs: extractResult
      expectExitCode: 0
      timeoutSeconds: 120

  # Step 3: Verify the output metadata JSON structure
  - assert:
      source: extractResult
      checks:
        # Check output contains success message
        - jsonPath: $.stdout
          expect:
            type: CONTAINS
            value: "Extracted 26 steps"

        # Check output contains plugin name
        - jsonPath: $.stdout
          expect:
            type: CONTAINS
            value: "workflow-basic-steps"

  # Step 4: Golden file comparison for full output
  - goldenAssert:
      actual: "{{temp}}/output/jenkins-metadata.json"
      expected: "workflow-basic-steps-1058.json"
      mode: JSON
      message: "Extracted metadata should match golden file"

            Review this pull request following the standards in AGENTS.md:

            **Code Quality:**
            - Kotlin conventions and null safety
            - Code readability and maintainability
            - Proper error handling

            **Security:**
            - No hardcoded credentials or secrets
            - Safe file operations (no path traversal)
            - Proper input validation

            **Testing:**
            - TDD followed (failing tests first)?
            - 80%+ coverage for public APIs
            - Edge cases covered

            **Performance:**
            - No N+1 queries or inefficient algorithms
            - Appropriate use of Kotlin sequences/collections
            - LSP protocol efficiency (request/response cycles)

            **Git Workflow:**
            - Conventional commit format
            - Explicit file additions (no wildcards)
            - Lint passes: ./gradlew lintFix
